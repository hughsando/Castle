Castle - 40th anniversary edition
=================================

The (an) original escape room game!  Choose your own way through the castle, and find the treasure.  So big, it covers 2 basic files.

Originally written on an Apple ][ clone 40 years ago (1982? dates/ages are a little hazy) it stands today as one of the all time classics.  The code is unchanged (except for replacing the ctrl-D characters with variables) and includes all the original text, including YOU/YOUR dyslexia.


[Run it online now!](https://hughsando.github.io/Castle/apple2js.html#castle)

Or, [download the disk image](https://github.com/hughsando/Castle/raw/main/dsk/castle.dsk) and run it for real.

Hints:
* 12 year old me was pretty belligerent and only afraid of snakes.

* When asked for the answer to a sum, press the digit and wait

* The random number generator in the emulator seems to give consistently unexpected results the first time a simulation is run, so try again.

* If all else fails, read the source code - it seems shorter than I remember it.

Thanks to [The apple2js project](https://github.com/whscullin/apple2js) for the emulator.
